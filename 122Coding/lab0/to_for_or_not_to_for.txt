  The largest number k that can be used before overflow occurs is the number
3,506,826,112.  Both of the functions will yeild exactly the sum result even after
overflow occurs.  However, the version without the for loop is obviously the
one to use.  Why use the for loop when the other is just as accurate and is
literally thousands of times faster?  No good reason, thats why.
