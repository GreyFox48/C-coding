Purpose:
  The purpose of the lab was to demonstrate the power of a more optimized
program, as well as show how to make estimates for time taken for some
functions.

Conclusions:
a)  What I had learned:
  I learned mostly how to use newton's method for finding a square root as well
as how to do a binary search.  While I had know how to use both for a while, I 
never had the reason to implement them before.

b)  Issues and how I had fixed them:
  The main issue was that the newton's method cube program would not terminate
properly.  How I had ultimatley fixed it was running the program in GDB to 
learnt that I had implemented the calculation run.  The bug was fixed by fixing
the equation.

c) Improvements that could be made:
