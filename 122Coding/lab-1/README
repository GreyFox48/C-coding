Lab 11

Purpose:
  To practice file input and output, by reading in locations from a file
organized in a standard format to be saved into an array of structures.  The
data was later printed out in two different formats, one for google Earth

Conclusions
a) What I learned in this lab
  I learned from this lab how to use fprintf, how to use getchar, and how to   
write to a file.  Otherwise, I got more practice with file input and output. 

b) Issues and how I fixed them
  The largest issue I had was reading in the city and location line, because
of slighly miscalculating the amount of characters in the city or location 
string.  This was fixed by implementing the remove /n function and being more
carefull.
  Otherwise the largest issue was a missing '<' in the kml file.

c)  Improvements that could be made
  The ability skip over the first three lines in the kml.c is rather jury-rigged.
The proper way would be to detect lines of the proper format and to read in the
line after.
