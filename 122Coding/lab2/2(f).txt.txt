For the most part, the curves follow the running time I had calculated
in step (a).  The foo1 is linear, and foo2 and foo4 have a slight curve, 
suggesting that it is quadratic.  Foo3 grows faster than foo2 and fo4,
suggesting that is is indeed cubic.  Foo5 grows the fastest of all functions,
which is appropriate as is was calculated to be a function with a power of 6.
Comparing the graphs, foo6 is less than foo5 but greater than foo3 in slope,
which suggests that it is of power of 4.
