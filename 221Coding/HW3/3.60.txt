A.  x is held in %rdi, n is held in %esi and then %ecx, result is held in %rax, and mask in held in %rdx
B.  The intial value of result is 0 and the intial value of max is 1
C.  The test condition for mask is whether or not it is equal to zero, meaning it will jne will jump if not zero
D.  Mask is updated by left shifting the value 8 times
E.  Result is updated by anding the value of result with mask and oring the result with the previous result
F.  the finished c code is
long loop(loop x, long n)
{
	long result = 0;
	long mask;
	for (mask = 1; mask != 0; mask <= 8) {
		result |= x & mask;
	}
	return result;
}
