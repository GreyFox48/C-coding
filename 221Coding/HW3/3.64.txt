A. Extended equation for the address of A[i][j][k] is
   x_n + L((T*i + j)*S + k), where x_n is the base address, T is the number of k indexes, and S is the number of j indexes
B. It can be determined that T= 5, S = 13, and R = 7.  T and S where determined form simplifying x_n + 8(65i + 13j + k) into the from from A.
   R was found by dividing the array size, 3640, with the values of the size of the elements, T, and S.  3640/8/5/13 = 7.
