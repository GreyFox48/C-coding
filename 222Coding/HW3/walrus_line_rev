Jooba jooba
Goo gooooooooooo jooba jooba jooba jooba jooba jooba
Goo goo goo joob goo goo goo joob
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob goo goo goo joob
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
Man you should have seen them kicking Edgar Alan Poe
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Semolina pilchard climbing up the Eiffel Tower

I'm crying
See how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snied
Don't you think the joker laughs at you? (Ha ha ha! He he he! Ha ha ha!)
Expert textpert choking smokers

I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob goo goo goo goo joob
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
You get a tan from standing in the English rain
If the sun don't come
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun

I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
Boy you been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down
Crabalocker fishwife pornographic priestess
Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye

I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
Mister City Policeman sitting, pretty little policemen in a row

I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
Man you been a naughty boy. You let your face grow long
Corporation teeshirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Sitting on a cornflake waiting for the van to come

I'm crying
See how they run like pigs from a gun see how they fly
And we are all together
I am he as you are he as you are me

"I Am The Walrus"
