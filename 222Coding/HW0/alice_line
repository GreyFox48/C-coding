10 CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
11 
12 Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
13 bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
14 book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
15 it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
16 conversation?'
17 
18 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
19 hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
20 of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
21 picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
22 close by her.
23 
24 There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
25 VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!
26 Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it
27 occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
28 it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH
29 OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
30 Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
31 never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch
32 to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
33 after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
34 rabbit-hole under the hedge.
35 
36 In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
37 in the world she was to get out again.
38 
39 The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
40 dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
41 about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
42 well.
43 
44 Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
45 plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
46 going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
47 she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
48 looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
49 cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
50 hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
51 she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great
52 disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
53 of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
54 she fell past it.
55 
56 'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall
57 think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
58 home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
59 of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)
60 
61 Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how
62 many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting
63 somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
64 thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
65 things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
66 was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
67 was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)
68 '--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
69 or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or
70 Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
71 
72 Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the
73 earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with
74 their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad
75 there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the
76 right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country
77 is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and
78 she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling
79 through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an
80 ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to
81 ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'
82 
83 Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
84 talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'
85 (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
86 tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
87 mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very
88 like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice
89 began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy
90 sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do
91 bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,
92 it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing
93 off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
94 Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:
95 did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon
96 a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
97 
98 Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
99 she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
100 long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
101 There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and
102 was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears
103 and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she
104 turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
105 herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
106 from the roof.
107 
108 There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
109 Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
110 door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
111 get out again.
112 
113 Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
114 glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's
115 first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
116 but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
117 but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
118 time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
119 behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
120 little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
121 
122 Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
123 much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage
124 into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
125 that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
126 those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
127 doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it
128 would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could
129 shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.'
130 For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
131 that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
132 impossible.
133 
134 There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
135 back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
136 any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
137 time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here
138 before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
139 label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large
140 letters.
141 
142 It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was
143 not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and
144 see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice
145 little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild
146 beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember
147 the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot
148 poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
149 finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never
150 forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is
151 almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
152 
153 However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste
154 it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour
155 of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot
156 buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
157 
158   *    *    *    *    *    *    *
159 
160     *    *    *    *    *    *
161 
162   *    *    *    *    *    *    *
163 
164 'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a
165 telescope.'
166 
167 And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
168 brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
169 through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
170 waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
171 she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said
172 Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
173 what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
174 candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
175 ever having seen such a thing.
176 
177 After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
178 into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
179 door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
180 went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
181 it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
182 best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
183 and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
184 sat down and cried.
185 
186 'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself,
187 rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally
188 gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
189 and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
190 her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
191 cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
192 for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
193 'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!
194 Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'
195 
196 Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
197 she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
198 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said
199 Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
200 makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll
201 get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'
202 
203 She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which
204 way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
205 growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
206 size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
207 had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
208 things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on
209 in the common way.
210 
211 So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

222 CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears
223 
224 'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
225 for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm
226 opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'
227 (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
228 sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder
229 who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure
230 _I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
231 myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be
232 kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want
233 to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'
234 
235 And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must
236 go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending
237 presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
238 
239      ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
240        HEARTHRUG,
241          NEAR THE FENDER,
242            (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).
243 
244 Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'
245 
246 Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
247 now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
248 key and hurried off to the garden door.
249 
250 Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
251 look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
252 hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
253 
254 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like
255 you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! Stop this
256 moment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
257 tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches
258 deep and reaching half down the hall.
259 
260 After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
261 she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
262 Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in
263 one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great
264 hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!
265 Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so
266 desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit
267 came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--'
268 The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,
269 and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
270 
271 Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
272 kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How
273 queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
274 I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
275 same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a
276 little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who
277 in the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began thinking
278 over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to
279 see if she could have been changed for any of them.
280 
281 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long
282 ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't
283 be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
284 very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling
285 it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me
286 see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and
287 four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
288 However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.
289 London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and
290 Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for
291 Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' and she crossed her
292 hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,
293 but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the
294 same as they used to do:--
295 
296      'How doth the little crocodile
297       Improve his shining tail,
298      And pour the waters of the Nile
299       On every golden scale!
300 
301      'How cheerfully he seems to grin,
302       How neatly spread his claws,
303      And welcome little fishes in
304       With gently smiling jaws!'
305 
306 'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes
307 filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and
308 I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
309 no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've
310 made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no
311 use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I
312 shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,
313 if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here
314 till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst
315 of tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired
316 of being all alone here!'
317 
318 As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
319 that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while
320 she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must
321 be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure
322 herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now
323 about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found
324 out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped
325 it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
326 
327 'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
328 sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and
329 now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:
330 but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was
331 lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'
332 thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!
333 And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'
334 
335 As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
336 she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she
337 had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by
338 railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
339 her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
340 to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
341 sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
342 of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon
343 made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she
344 was nine feet high.
345 
346 'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying
347 to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
348 being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!
349 However, everything is queer to-day.'
350 
351 Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
352 off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
353 it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
354 she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
355 slipped in like herself.
356 
357 'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?
358 Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
359 likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she
360 began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
361 of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right
362 way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
363 she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of
364 a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather
365 inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
366 but it said nothing.
367 
368 'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's
369 a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all
370 her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
371 anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which
372 was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
373 sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
374 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt
375 the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'
376 
377 'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would
378 YOU like cats if you were me?'
379 
380 'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry
381 about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
382 take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet
383 thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
384 pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and
385 washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's
386 such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried
387 Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
388 felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any
389 more if you'd rather not.'
390 
391 'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
392 tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED
393 cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'
394 
395 'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
396 conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not
397 answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near
398 our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
399 know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when
400 you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
401 of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,
402 you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He
403 says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful
404 tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming
405 away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in
406 the pool as it went.
407 
408 So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
409 won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the
410 Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its
411 face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
412 trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
413 history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'
414 
415 It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
416 birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,
417 a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
418 way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
419 
420 
421 
422 
423 CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
424 
425 They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the
426 birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
427 to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
428 
429 The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
430 consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
431 to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
432 known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
433 Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than
434 you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without
435 knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its
436 age, there was no more to be said.
437 
438 At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
439 called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you
440 dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse
441 in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
442 sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
443 
444 'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This
445 is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! "William
446 the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
447 to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
448 accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
449 Mercia and Northumbria--"'
450 
451 'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.
452 
453 'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did
454 you speak?'
455 
456 'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.
457 
458 'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. "Edwin and Morcar,
459 the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,
460 the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--"'
461 
462 'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.
463 
464 'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what
465 "it" means.'
466 
467 'I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the
468 Duck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
469 archbishop find?'
470 
471 The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '"--found
472 it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
473 crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his
474 Normans--" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning
475 to Alice as it spoke.
476 
477 'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to
478 dry me at all.'
479 
480 'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move
481 that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
482 remedies--'
483 
484 'Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half
485 those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And
486 the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
487 tittered audibly.
488 
489 'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that
490 the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'
491 
492 'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,
493 but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,
494 and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
495 
496 'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as
497 you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell
498 you how the Dodo managed it.)
499 
500 First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact
501 shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed
502 along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and
503 away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
504 liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
505 when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
506 the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded
507 round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'
508 
509 This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
510 and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
511 (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures
512 of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,
513 'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'
514 
515 'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.
516 
517 'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;
518 and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused
519 way, 'Prizes! Prizes!'
520 
521 Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
522 pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
523 not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one
524 a-piece all round.
525 
526 'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.
527 
528 'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in
529 your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.
530 
531 'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.
532 
533 'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.
534 
535 Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
536 presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant
537 thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
538 
539 Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
540 that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
541 to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
542 could.
543 
544 The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
545 confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
546 theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
547 However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
548 begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
549 
550 'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why
551 it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
552 would be offended again.
553 
554 'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
555 sighing.
556 
557 'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at
558 the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling
559 about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was
560 something like this:--
561 
562          'Fury said to a
563          mouse, That he
564         met in the
565        house,
566      "Let us
567       both go to
568        law: I will
569         prosecute
570          YOU.--Come,
571            I'll take no
572            denial; We
573           must have a
574         trial: For
575       really this
576      morning I've
577     nothing
578     to do."
579      Said the
580       mouse to the
581        cur, "Such
582         a trial,
583          dear Sir,
584             With
585           no jury
586         or judge,
587        would be
588       wasting
589       our
590       breath."
591        "I'll be
592         judge, I'll
593          be jury,"
594             Said
595          cunning
596           old Fury:
597           "I'll
598           try the
599             whole
600             cause,
601               and
602            condemn
603            you
604           to
605            death."'
606 
607 
608 'You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely. 'What are you
609 thinking of?'
610 
611 'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifth
612 bend, I think?'
613 
614 'I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
615 
616 'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
617 anxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me help to undo it!'
618 
619 'I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up and walking
620 away. 'You insult me by talking such nonsense!'
621 
622 'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. 'But you're so easily offended,
623 you know!'
624 
625 The Mouse only growled in reply.
626 
627 'Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after it; and the
628 others all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook
629 its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
630 
631 'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite
632 out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her
633 daughter 'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
634 YOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the young Crab, a little
635 snappishly. 'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!'
636 
637 'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressing
638 nobody in particular. 'She'd soon fetch it back!'
639 
640 'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' said the
641 Lory.
642 
643 Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
644 'Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you
645 can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
646 she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'
647 
648 This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
649 birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
650 carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-air
651 doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to
652 its children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!'
653 On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.
654 
655 'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholy
656 tone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
657 cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
658 any more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
659 lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard
660 a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
661 eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
662 back to finish his story.
663 
664 
665 
666 
667 CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
668 
669 It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
670 anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
671 it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
672 my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
673 ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a
674 moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
675 and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
676 nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
677 the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,
678 had vanished completely.
679 
680 Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
681 called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing
682 out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!
683 Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once
684 in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it
685 had made.
686 
687 'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How
688 surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him
689 his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she
690 came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
691 plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without
692 knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
693 real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
694 fan and gloves.
695 
696 'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for
697 a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she
698 began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come
699 here directly, and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a minute,
700 nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't
701 think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it
702 began ordering people about like that!'
703 
704 By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
705 in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
706 of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
707 and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
708 bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time
709 with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
710 to her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said
711 to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what
712 this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really
713 I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'
714 
715 It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
716 drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
717 and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
718 down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't
719 grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't
720 drunk quite so much!'
721 
722 Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
723 and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
724 was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
725 one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
726 Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
727 of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I
728 can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'
729 
730 Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
731 and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
732 seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
733 again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
734 
735 'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't
736 always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
737 rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and
738 yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
739 CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that
740 kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!
741 There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I
742 grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful
743 tone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.'
744 
745 'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am
746 now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but
747 then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'
748 
749 'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn
750 lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all
751 for any lesson-books!'
752 
753 And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making
754 quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard
755 a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
756 
757 'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!'
758 Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
759 the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
760 house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
761 as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
762 
763 Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
764 the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
765 that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll
766 go round and get in at the window.'
767 
768 'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
769 she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
770 hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
771 but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
772 from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
773 cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
774 
775 Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And
776 then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging
777 for apples, yer honour!'
778 
779 'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and
780 help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)
781 
782 'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'
783 
784 'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')
785 
786 'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
787 window!'
788 
789 'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'
790 
791 'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'
792 
793 There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
794 now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
795 all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her
796 hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
797 TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of
798 cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do
799 next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm
800 sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'
801 
802 She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
803 rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices
804 all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other
805 ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!
806 fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em
807 together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll
808 do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this
809 rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming
810 down! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I
811 fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I
812 won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to
813 go down the chimney!'
814 
815 'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to
816 herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
817 Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
818 I THINK I can kick a little!'
819 
820 She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited
821 till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)
822 scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
823 saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to
824 see what would happen next.
825 
826 The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!'
827 then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then
828 silence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy
829 now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
830 us all about it!'
831 
832 Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought
833 Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm
834 a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me
835 like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'
836 
837 'So you did, old fellow!' said the others.
838 
839 'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called
840 out as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!'
841 
842 There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I
843 wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the
844 roof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
845 Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'
846 
847 'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
848 for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
849 window, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,'
850 she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!'
851 which produced another dead silence.
852 
853 Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
854 little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
855 head. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make
856 SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must
857 make me smaller, I suppose.'
858 
859 So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
860 began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through
861 the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
862 animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was
863 in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
864 something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
865 appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
866 safe in a thick wood.
867 
868 'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered
869 about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second
870 thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be
871 the best plan.'
872 
873 It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
874 arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
875 how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
876 the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
877 great hurry.
878 
879 An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
880 feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'
881 said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but
882 she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be
883 hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
884 all her coaxing.
885 
886 Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
887 held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
888 all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
889 and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
890 to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
891 other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
892 over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
893 very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
894 moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
895 the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
896 little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
897 all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
898 its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
899 
900 This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
901 set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and
902 till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
903 
904 'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant
905 against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
906 leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd
907 only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
908 I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I
909 suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
910 question is, what?'
911 
912 The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
913 the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
914 looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
915 There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
916 herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
917 behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
918 was on the top of it.
919 
920 She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
921 mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
922 that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long
923 hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.
924 
925 
926 
927 
928 CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar
929 
930 The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
931 at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
932 her in a languid, sleepy voice.
933 
934 'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.
935 
936 This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
937 rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know
938 who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
939 changed several times since then.'
940 
941 'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain
942 yourself!'
943 
944 'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not
945 myself, you see.'
946 
947 'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.
948 
949 'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,
950 'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
951 different sizes in a day is very confusing.'
952 
953 'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.
954 
955 'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you
956 have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
957 after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
958 queer, won't you?'
959 
960 'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.
961 
962 'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know
963 is, it would feel very queer to ME.'
964 
965 'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'
966 
967 Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
968 Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY
969 short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,
970 you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'
971 
972 'Why?' said the Caterpillar.
973 
974 Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
975 good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant
976 state of mind, she turned away.
977 
978 'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important
979 to say!'
980 
981 This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
982 
983 'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.
984 
985 'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
986 could.
987 
988 'No,' said the Caterpillar.
989 
990 Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
991 perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some
992 minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
993 arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think
994 you're changed, do you?'
995 
996 'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I
997 used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'
998 
999 'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.
1000 
1001 'Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it all came
1002 different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
1003 
1004 'Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.
1005 
1006 Alice folded her hands, and began:--
1007 
1008    'You are old, Father William,' the young man said,
1009     'And your hair has become very white;
1010    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
1011     Do you think, at your age, it is right?'
1012 
1013    'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,
1014     'I feared it might injure the brain;
1015    But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
1016     Why, I do it again and again.'
1017 
1018    'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,
1019     And have grown most uncommonly fat;
1020    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
1021     Pray, what is the reason of that?'
1022 
1023    'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
1024     'I kept all my limbs very supple
1025    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
1026     Allow me to sell you a couple?'
1027 
1028    'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak
1029     For anything tougher than suet;
1030    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
1031     Pray how did you manage to do it?'
1032 
1033    'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law,
1034     And argued each case with my wife;
1035    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
1036     Has lasted the rest of my life.'
1037 
1038    'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose
1039     That your eye was as steady as ever;
1040    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
1041     What made you so awfully clever?'
1042 
1043    'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'
1044     Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs!
1045    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
1046     Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'
1047 
1048 
1049 'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.
1050 
1051 'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words
1052 have got altered.'
1053 
1054 'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and
1055 there was silence for some minutes.
1056 
1057 The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
1058 
1059 'What size do you want to be?' it asked.
1060 
1061 'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one
1062 doesn't like changing so often, you know.'
1063 
1064 'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
1065 
1066 Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
1067 before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
1068 
1069 'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.
1070 
1071 'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'
1072 said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'
1073 
1074 'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
1075 itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
1076 
1077 'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And
1078 she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
1079 offended!'
1080 
1081 'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the
1082 hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
1083 
1084 This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In
1085 a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth
1086 and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
1087 mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
1088 'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
1089 grow shorter.'
1090 
1091 'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself.
1092 
1093 'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
1094 aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
1095 
1096 Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
1097 to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
1098 round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she
1099 stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit
1100 of the edge with each hand.
1101 
1102 'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
1103 the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent
1104 blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
1105 
1106 She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
1107 that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
1108 set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
1109 so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
1110 mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
1111 lefthand bit.
1112 
1113 
1114   *    *    *    *    *    *    *
1115 
1116     *    *    *    *    *    *
1117 
1118   *    *    *    *    *    *    *
1119 
1120 'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which
1121 changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
1122 were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
1123 an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
1124 sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
1125 
1126 'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my
1127 shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?'
1128 She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
1129 except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
1130 
1131 As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she
1132 tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her
1133 neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had
1134 just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going
1135 to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops
1136 of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made
1137 her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and
1138 was beating her violently with its wings.
1139 
1140 'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.
1141 
1142 'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'
1143 
1144 'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,
1145 and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems
1146 to suit them!'
1147 
1148 'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.
1149 
1150 'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
1151 hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those
1152 serpents! There's no pleasing them!'
1153 
1154 Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
1155 saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
1156 
1157 'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon;
1158 'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
1159 haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'
1160 
1161 'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to
1162 see its meaning.
1163 
1164 'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the
1165 Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I
1166 should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from
1167 the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'
1168 
1169 'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--'
1170 
1171 'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying to
1172 invent something!'
1173 
1174 'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
1175 the number of changes she had gone through that day.
1176 
1177 'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
1178 contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE
1179 with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use
1180 denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an
1181 egg!'
1182 
1183 'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful
1184 child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
1185 know.'
1186 
1187 'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're
1188 a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'
1189 
1190 This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
1191 minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're
1192 looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me
1193 whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'
1194 
1195 'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking
1196 for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't
1197 like them raw.'
1198 
1199 'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
1200 down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as
1201 she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
1202 every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she
1203 remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
1204 she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
1205 other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
1206 succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
1207 
1208 It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
1209 felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
1210 and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done
1211 now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going
1212 to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right
1213 size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that
1214 to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open
1215 place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives
1216 there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,
1217 I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the
1218 righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she
1219 had brought herself down to nine inches high.
1220 
1221 
1222 
1223 
1224 CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper
1225 
1226 For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
1227 to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
1228 wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
1229 otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
1230 fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened
1231 by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
1232 frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all
1233 over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,
1234 and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
1235 
1236 The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
1237 nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
1238 saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen
1239 to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,
1240 only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An
1241 invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'
1242 
1243 Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
1244 
1245 Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the
1246 wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
1247 Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
1248 door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
1249 
1250 Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
1251 
1252 'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for
1253 two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you
1254 are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could
1255 possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise
1256 going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
1257 a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.
1258 
1259 'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'
1260 
1261 'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on
1262 without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance,
1263 if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'
1264 He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this
1265 Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she
1266 said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.
1267 But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she
1268 repeated, aloud.
1269 
1270 'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'
1271 
1272 At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
1273 skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,
1274 and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
1275 
1276 '--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
1277 as if nothing had happened.
1278 
1279 'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
1280 
1281 'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first
1282 question, you know.'
1283 
1284 It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really
1285 dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.
1286 It's enough to drive one crazy!'
1287 
1288 The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
1289 remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for
1290 days and days.'
1291 
1292 'But what am I to do?' said Alice.
1293 
1294 'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.
1295 
1296 'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's
1297 perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.
1298 
1299 The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
1300 one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in
1301 the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
1302 a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
1303 
1304 'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,
1305 as well as she could for sneezing.
1306 
1307 There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess
1308 sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
1309 alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen
1310 that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on
1311 the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
1312 
1313 'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
1314 not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why
1315 your cat grins like that?'
1316 
1317 'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'
1318 
1319 She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
1320 jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
1321 and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--
1322 
1323 'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know
1324 that cats COULD grin.'
1325 
1326 'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'
1327 
1328 'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite
1329 pleased to have got into a conversation.
1330 
1331 'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'
1332 
1333 Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
1334 be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
1335 was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
1336 fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
1337 the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a
1338 shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
1339 them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
1340 that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
1341 
1342 'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in
1343 an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually
1344 large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.
1345 
1346 'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse
1347 growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'
1348 
1349 'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get
1350 an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of
1351 what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes
1352 twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'
1353 
1354 'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'
1355 
1356 Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
1357 the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
1358 be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is
1359 it twelve? I--'
1360 
1361 'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'
1362 And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of
1363 lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of
1364 every line:
1365 
1366    'Speak roughly to your little boy,
1367     And beat him when he sneezes:
1368    He only does it to annoy,
1369     Because he knows it teases.'
1370 
1371          CHORUS.
1372 
1373  (In which the cook and the baby joined):--
1374 
1375        'Wow! wow! wow!'
1376 
1377 While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
1378 the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
1379 that Alice could hardly hear the words:--
1380 
1381    'I speak severely to my boy,
1382     I beat him when he sneezes;
1383    For he can thoroughly enjoy
1384     The pepper when he pleases!'
1385 
1386          CHORUS.
1387 
1388        'Wow! wow! wow!'
1389 
1390 'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice,
1391 flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play
1392 croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw
1393 a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
1394 
1395 Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
1396 little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just
1397 like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting
1398 like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and
1399 straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute
1400 or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
1401 
1402 As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
1403 twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
1404 ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried
1405 it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'
1406 thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be
1407 murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the
1408 little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
1409 'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing
1410 yourself.'
1411 
1412 The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to
1413 see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
1414 a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its
1415 eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not
1416 like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,'
1417 she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any
1418 tears.
1419 
1420 No, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'
1421 said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
1422 now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
1423 to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.
1424 
1425 Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with
1426 this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently,
1427 that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could
1428 be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she
1429 felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.
1430 
1431 So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see
1432 it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said
1433 to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
1434 rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other
1435 children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
1436 to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she
1437 was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
1438 tree a few yards off.
1439 
1440 The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
1441 thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she
1442 felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
1443 
1444 'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
1445 whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
1446 'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you
1447 tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'
1448 
1449 'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.
1450 
1451 'I don't much care where--' said Alice.
1452 
1453 'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.
1454 
1455 '--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.
1456 
1457 'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long
1458 enough.'
1459 
1460 Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.
1461 'What sort of people live about here?'
1462 
1463 'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives
1464 a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March
1465 Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'
1466 
1467 'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.
1468 
1469 'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.
1470 You're mad.'
1471 
1472 'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.
1473 
1474 'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'
1475 
1476 Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how
1477 do you know that you're mad?'
1478 
1479 'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?'
1480 
1481 'I suppose so,' said Alice.
1482 
1483 'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,
1484 and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and
1485 wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'
1486 
1487 'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.
1488 
1489 'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the
1490 Queen to-day?'
1491 
1492 'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited
1493 yet.'
1494 
1495 'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.
1496 
1497 Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
1498 things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
1499 it suddenly appeared again.
1500 
1501 'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly
1502 forgotten to ask.'
1503 
1504 'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
1505 in a natural way.
1506 
1507 'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.
1508 
1509 Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
1510 appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
1511 which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she
1512 said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
1513 perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as
1514 it was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
1515 again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
1516 
1517 'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.
1518 
1519 'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and
1520 vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'
1521 
1522 'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
1523 beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
1524 remained some time after the rest of it had gone.
1525 
1526 'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin
1527 without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'
1528 
1529 She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house
1530 of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
1531 chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
1532 was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
1533 nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to
1534 about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,
1535 saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost
1536 wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!'
1537 
1538 
1539 
1540 
1541 CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party
1542 
1543 There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
1544 March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
1545 between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
1546 cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very
1547 uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
1548 suppose it doesn't mind.'
1549 
1550 The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
1551 one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice
1552 coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat
1553 down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
1554 
1555 'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
1556 
1557 Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
1558 'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.
1559 
1560 'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.
1561 
1562 'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.
1563 
1564 'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said
1565 the March Hare.
1566 
1567 'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great
1568 many more than three.'
1569 
1570 'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice
1571 for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.
1572 
1573 'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some
1574 severity; 'it's very rude.'
1575 
1576 The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID
1577 was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'
1578 
1579 'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've
1580 begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.
1581 
1582 'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the
1583 March Hare.
1584 
1585 'Exactly so,' said Alice.
1586 
1587 'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.
1588 
1589 'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I
1590 say--that's the same thing, you know.'
1591 
1592 'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say
1593 that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!'
1594 
1595 'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what I
1596 get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'
1597 
1598 'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
1599 talking in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing
1600 as "I sleep when I breathe"!'
1601 
1602 'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the
1603 conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
1604 thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
1605 which wasn't much.
1606 
1607 The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month
1608 is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
1609 pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
1610 and holding it to his ear.
1611 
1612 Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'
1613 
1614 'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit
1615 the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
1616 
1617 'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.
1618 
1619 'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:
1620 'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'
1621 
1622 The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
1623 it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
1624 nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,
1625 you know.'
1626 
1627 Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a
1628 funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
1629 tell what o'clock it is!'
1630 
1631 'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you what
1632 year it is?'
1633 
1634 'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it
1635 stays the same year for such a long time together.'
1636 
1637 'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.
1638 
1639 Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no
1640 sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite
1641 understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.
1642 
1643 'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little
1644 hot tea upon its nose.
1645 
1646 The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
1647 eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'
1648 
1649 'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice
1650 again.
1651 
1652 'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'
1653 
1654 'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.
1655 
1656 'Nor I,' said the March Hare.
1657 
1658 Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the
1659 time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'
1660 
1661 'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk
1662 about wasting IT. It's HIM.'
1663 
1664 'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.
1665 
1666 'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.
1667 'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'
1668 
1669 'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time
1670 when I learn music.'
1671 
1672 'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating.
1673 Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything
1674 you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in
1675 the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a
1676 hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
1677 time for dinner!'
1678 
1679 ('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)
1680 
1681 'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I
1682 shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'
1683 
1684 'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to
1685 half-past one as long as you liked.'
1686 
1687 'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.
1688 
1689 The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We
1690 quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing
1691 with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert
1692 given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
1693 
1694      "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
1695      How I wonder what you're at!"
1696 
1697 You know the song, perhaps?'
1698 
1699 'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.
1700 
1701 'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--
1702 
1703      "Up above the world you fly,
1704      Like a tea-tray in the sky.
1705          Twinkle, twinkle--"'
1706 
1707 Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle,
1708 twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch
1709 it to make it stop.
1710 
1711 'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the
1712 Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the time! Off with his
1713 head!"'
1714 
1715 'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.
1716 
1717 'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't
1718 do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'
1719 
1720 A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so many
1721 tea-things are put out here?' she asked.
1722 
1723 'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time,
1724 and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'
1725 
1726 'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.
1727 
1728 'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.'
1729 
1730 'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured
1731 to ask.
1732 
1733 'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
1734 'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.'
1735 
1736 'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the
1737 proposal.
1738 
1739 'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And
1740 they pinched it on both sides at once.
1741 
1742 The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a
1743 hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'
1744 
1745 'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.
1746 
1747 'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.
1748 
1749 'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again
1750 before it's done.'
1751 
1752 'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began
1753 in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
1754 they lived at the bottom of a well--'
1755 
1756 'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in
1757 questions of eating and drinking.
1758 
1759 'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
1760 two.
1761 
1762 'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd
1763 have been ill.'
1764 
1765 'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'
1766 
1767 Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
1768 living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But
1769 why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
1770 
1771 'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
1772 
1773 'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't
1774 take more.'
1775 
1776 'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take
1777 MORE than nothing.'
1778 
1779 'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.
1780 
1781 'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.
1782 
1783 Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
1784 to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
1785 repeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
1786 
1787 The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
1788 said, 'It was a treacle-well.'
1789 
1790 'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
1791 Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily
1792 remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
1793 yourself.'
1794 
1795 'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I
1796 dare say there may be ONE.'
1797 
1798 'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
1799 go on. 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
1800 you know--'
1801 
1802 'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
1803 
1804 'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
1805 
1806 'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place
1807 on.'
1808 
1809 He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
1810 moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took
1811 the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
1812 advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
1813 before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
1814 
1815 Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
1816 cautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle
1817 from?'
1818 
1819 'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should
1820 think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'
1821 
1822 'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to
1823 notice this last remark.
1824 
1825 'Of course they were', said the Dormouse; '--well in.'
1826 
1827 This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
1828 some time without interrupting it.
1829 
1830 'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
1831 its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of
1832 things--everything that begins with an M--'
1833 
1834 'Why with an M?' said Alice.
1835 
1836 'Why not?' said the March Hare.
1837 
1838 Alice was silent.
1839 
1840 The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into
1841 a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with
1842 a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as
1843 mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say
1844 things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever see such a thing as a
1845 drawing of a muchness?'
1846 
1847 'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't
1848 think--'
1849 
1850 'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.
1851 
1852 This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
1853 great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
1854 neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
1855 looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
1856 the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
1857 the teapot.
1858 
1859 'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked her
1860 way through the wood. 'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all
1861 my life!'
1862 
1863 Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
1864 leading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'But
1865 everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in
1866 she went.
1867 
1868 Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
1869 glass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,
1870 and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
1871 led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she
1872 had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:
1873 then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at
1874 last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool
1875 fountains.
1876

1879 
1880 CHAPTER VIII. The Queen's Croquet-Ground
1881 
1882 A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
1883 growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
1884 painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went
1885 nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of
1886 them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like
1887 that!'
1888 
1889 'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my
1890 elbow.'
1891 
1892 On which Seven looked up and said, 'That's right, Five! Always lay the
1893 blame on others!'
1894 
1895 'YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. 'I heard the Queen say only
1896 yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'
1897 
1898 'What for?' said the one who had spoken first.
1899 
1900 'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.
1901 
1902 'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was for
1903 bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'
1904 
1905 Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust
1906 things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
1907 them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and
1908 all of them bowed low.
1909 
1910 'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are painting
1911 those roses?'
1912 
1913 Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
1914 voice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
1915 RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
1916 was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.
1917 So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this
1918 moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
1919 out 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threw
1920 themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
1921 and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
1922 
1923 First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like
1924 the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
1925 corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
1926 diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
1927 the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
1928 jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented
1929 with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among
1930 them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried
1931 nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
1932 noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's
1933 crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand
1934 procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
1935 
1936 Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
1937 like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
1938 of such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the use of
1939 a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their
1940 faces, so that they couldn't see it?' So she stood still where she was,
1941 and waited.
1942 
1943 When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
1944 at her, and the Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to the
1945 Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
1946 
1947 'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
1948 Alice, she went on, 'What's your name, child?'
1949 
1950 'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely;
1951 but she added, to herself, 'Why, they're only a pack of cards, after
1952 all. I needn't be afraid of them!'
1953 
1954 'And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who
1955 were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their
1956 faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the
1957 pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or
1958 courtiers, or three of her own children.
1959 
1960 'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 'It's no
1961 business of MINE.'
1962 
1963 The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
1964 moment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--'
1965 
1966 'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
1967 silent.
1968 
1969 The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my
1970 dear: she is only a child!'
1971 
1972 The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them
1973 over!'
1974 
1975 The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
1976 
1977 'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
1978 gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
1979 the royal children, and everybody else.
1980 
1981 'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then,
1982 turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'
1983 
1984 'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going
1985 down on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--'
1986 
1987 'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
1988 'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the
1989 soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
1990 to Alice for protection.
1991 
1992 'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large
1993 flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
1994 minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
1995 others.
1996 
1997 'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.
1998 
1999 'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted
2000 in reply.
2001 
2002 'That's right!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?'
2003 
2004 The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
2005 evidently meant for her.
2006 
2007 'Yes!' shouted Alice.
2008 
2009 'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
2010 wondering very much what would happen next.
2011 
2012 'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was
2013 walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
2014 
2015 'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'
2016 
2017 'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
2018 anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
2019 tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under
2020 sentence of execution.'
2021 
2022 'What for?' said Alice.
2023 
2024 'Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.
2025 
2026 'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said
2027 "What for?"'
2028 
2029 'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
2030 scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
2031 tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
2032 Queen said--'
2033 
2034 'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
2035 people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
2036 other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
2037 began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
2038 her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,
2039 the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves
2040 up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
2041 
2042 The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
2043 she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under
2044 her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got
2045 its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a
2046 blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,
2047 with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out
2048 laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin
2049 again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
2050 itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was
2051 generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the
2052 hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up
2053 and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the
2054 conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
2055 
2056 The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
2057 all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short
2058 time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
2059 shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a
2060 minute.
2061 
2062 Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
2063 dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
2064 'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully
2065 fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one
2066 left alive!'
2067 
2068 She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
2069 could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance
2070 in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it
2071 a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself
2072 'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'
2073 
2074 'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
2075 enough for it to speak with.
2076 
2077 Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use
2078 speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one
2079 of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
2080 down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
2081 she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was
2082 enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.
2083 
2084 'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a
2085 complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
2086 oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;
2087 at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how
2088 confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the
2089 arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
2090 ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only
2091 it ran away when it saw mine coming!'
2092 
2093 'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.
2094 
2095 'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed
2096 that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
2097 '--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'
2098 
2099 The Queen smiled and passed on.
2100 
2101 'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking
2102 at the Cat's head with great curiosity.
2103 
2104 'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to
2105 introduce it.'
2106 
2107 'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may
2108 kiss my hand if it likes.'
2109 
2110 'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.
2111 
2112 'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'
2113 He got behind Alice as he spoke.
2114 
2115 'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book,
2116 but I don't remember where.'
2117 
2118 'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called
2119 the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would
2120 have this cat removed!'
2121 
2122 The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.
2123 'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.
2124 
2125 'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he
2126 hurried off.
2127 
2128 Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
2129 on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with
2130 passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
2131 executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
2132 of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
2133 whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.
2134 
2135 The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
2136 to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
2137 other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the
2138 other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless
2139 sort of way to fly up into a tree.
2140 
2141 By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
2142 was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't
2143 matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side
2144 of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
2145 escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
2146 friend.
2147 
2148 When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a
2149 large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
2150 the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
2151 while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.
2152 
2153 The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
2154 the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
2155 all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
2156 what they said.
2157 
2158 The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless
2159 there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
2160 thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.
2161 
2162 The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be
2163 beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.
2164 
2165 The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less
2166 than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last
2167 remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)
2168 
2169 Alice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess:
2170 you'd better ask HER about it.'
2171 
2172 'She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.'
2173 And the executioner went off like an arrow.
2174 
2175  The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
2176 by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely
2177 disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down
2178 looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.
2179 
2180 
2181 
2182 
2183 CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle's Story
2184 
2185 'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!'
2186 said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and
2187 they walked off together.
2188 
2189 Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
2190 to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
2191 savage when they met in the kitchen.
2192 
2193 'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
2194 though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very
2195 well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,'
2196 she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of
2197 rule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes
2198 them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children
2199 sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so
2200 stingy about it, you know--'
2201 
2202 She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
2203 startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking
2204 about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't
2205 tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
2206 a bit.'
2207 
2208 'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.
2209 
2210 'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only
2211 you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
2212 she spoke.
2213 
2214 Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
2215 Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
2216 right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an
2217 uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
2218 bore it as well as she could.
2219 
2220 'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up
2221 the conversation a little.
2222 
2223 ''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love,
2224 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'
2225 
2226 'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding
2227 their own business!'
2228 
2229 'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her
2230 sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral
2231 of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
2232 themselves."'
2233 
2234 'How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to herself.
2235 
2236 'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,'
2237 the Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about
2238 the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?'
2239 
2240 'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to
2241 have the experiment tried.
2242 
2243 'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
2244 the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock together."'
2245 
2246 'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.
2247 
2248 'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of
2249 putting things!'
2250 
2251 'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.
2252 
2253 'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
2254 everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And
2255 the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the less there is of
2256 yours."'
2257 
2258 'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,
2259 'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.'
2260 
2261 'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that
2262 is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put more
2263 simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
2264 appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
2265 than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise."'
2266 
2267 'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if
2268 I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'
2269 
2270 'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in
2271 a pleased tone.
2272 
2273 'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said
2274 Alice.
2275 
2276 'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 'I make you a present
2277 of everything I've said as yet.'
2278 
2279 'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give
2280 birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to say it out
2281 loud.
2282 
2283 'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
2284 little chin.
2285 
2286 'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
2287 feel a little worried.
2288 
2289 'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and
2290 the m--'
2291 
2292 But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even
2293 in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked
2294 into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen
2295 in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.
2296 
2297 'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
2298 
2299 'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the
2300 ground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that in
2301 about half no time! Take your choice!'
2302 
2303 The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.
2304 
2305 'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was
2306 too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
2307 croquet-ground.
2308 
2309 The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were
2310 resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
2311 back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would
2312 cost them their lives.
2313 
2314 All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with
2315 the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her
2316 head!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,
2317 who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by
2318 the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the
2319 players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and
2320 under sentence of execution.
2321 
2322 Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have
2323 you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'
2324 
2325 'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'
2326 
2327 'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.
2328 
2329 'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.
2330 
2331 'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'
2332 
2333 As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
2334 to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good
2335 thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
2336 number of executions the Queen had ordered.
2337 
2338 They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.
2339 (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy
2340 thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock
2341 Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
2342 executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with
2343 the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on
2344 the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
2345 after that savage Queen: so she waited.
2346 
2347 The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
2348 she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,
2349 half to itself, half to Alice.
2350 
2351 'What IS the fun?' said Alice.
2352 
2353 'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never
2354 executes nobody, you know. Come on!'
2355 
2356 'Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly
2357 after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'
2358 
2359 They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
2360 sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
2361 nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
2362 pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the
2363 Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his
2364 fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'
2365 
2366 So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
2367 full of tears, but said nothing.
2368 
2369 'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your
2370 history, she do.'
2371 
2372 'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit
2373 down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'
2374 
2375 So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
2376 herself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But
2377 she waited patiently.
2378 
2379 'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real
2380 Turtle.'
2381 
2382 These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
2383 occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant
2384 heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
2385 saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could
2386 not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said
2387 nothing.
2388 
2389 'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
2390 though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the
2391 sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'
2392 
2393 'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.
2394 
2395 'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle
2396 angrily: 'really you are very dull!'
2397 
2398 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'
2399 added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
2400 Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said
2401 to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'
2402 and he went on in these words:
2403 
2404 'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'
2405 
2406 'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.
2407 
2408 'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.
2409 
2410 'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
2411 The Mock Turtle went on.
2412 
2413 'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'
2414 
2415 'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud
2416 as all that.'
2417 
2418 'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
2419 
2420 'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'
2421 
2422 'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.
2423 
2424 'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.
2425 
2426 'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in
2427 a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,
2428 "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'
2429 
2430 'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of
2431 the sea.'
2432 
2433 'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I
2434 only took the regular course.'
2435 
2436 'What was that?' inquired Alice.
2437 
2438 'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle
2439 replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,
2440 Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'
2441 
2442 'I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'
2443 
2444 The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of
2445 uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'
2446 
2447 'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'
2448 
2449 'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,
2450 you ARE a simpleton.'
2451 
2452 Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
2453 turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'
2454 
2455 'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off
2456 the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with
2457 Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
2458 that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
2459 Fainting in Coils.'
2460 
2461 'What was THAT like?' said Alice.
2462 
2463 'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too
2464 stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'
2465 
2466 'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.
2467 He was an old crab, HE was.'
2468 
2469 'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught
2470 Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'
2471 
2472 'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
2473 creatures hid their faces in their paws.
2474 
2475 'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to
2476 change the subject.
2477 
2478 'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so
2479 on.'
2480 
2481 'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.
2482 
2483 'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked:
2484 'because they lessen from day to day.'
2485 
2486 This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
2487 before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a
2488 holiday?'
2489 
2490 'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.
2491 
2492 'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.
2493 
2494 'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided
2495 tone: 'tell her something about the games now.'
2496 
2497 
2498 
2499 
2500 CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille
2501 
2502 The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
2503 his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
2504 two sobs choked his voice. 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,'
2505 said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
2506 the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
2507 running down his cheeks, he went on again:--
2508 
2509 'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said
2510 Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'
2511 (Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and
2512 said 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
2513 Lobster Quadrille is!'
2514 
2515 'No, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?'
2516 
2517 'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the
2518 sea-shore--'
2519 
2520 'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
2521 then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'
2522 
2523 'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.
2524 
2525 '--you advance twice--'
2526 
2527 'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.
2528 
2529 'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--'
2530 
2531 '--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.
2532 
2533 'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--'
2534 
2535 'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
2536 
2537 '--as far out to sea as you can--'
2538 
2539 'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.
2540 
2541 'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
2542 about.
2543 
2544 'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.
2545 
2546 'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock
2547 Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been
2548 jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly
2549 and quietly, and looked at Alice.
2550 
2551 'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.
2552 
2553 'Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.
2554 
2555 'Very much indeed,' said Alice.
2556 
2557 'Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
2558 'We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?'
2559 
2560 'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. 'I've forgotten the words.'
2561 
2562 So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
2563 then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
2564 forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
2565 and sadly:--
2566 
2567  '"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.
2568  "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.
2569 
2570  See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
2571  They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?
2572 
2573  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
2574  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
2575 
2576  "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
2577  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"
2578  But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance--
2579  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
2580 
2581  Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
2582  Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.
2583 
2584  '"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
2585  "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
2586  The further off from England the nearer is to France--
2587  Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
2588 
2589  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
2590  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"'
2591 
2592 'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling
2593 very glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious song
2594 about the whiting!'
2595 
2596 'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, 'they--you've seen them,
2597 of course?'
2598 
2599 'Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she checked herself
2600 hastily.
2601 
2602 'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, 'but if you've
2603 seen them so often, of course you know what they're like.'
2604 
2605 'I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. 'They have their tails in
2606 their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'
2607 
2608 'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all
2609 wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the
2610 reason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her
2611 about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.
2612 
2613 'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters
2614 to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long
2615 way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get
2616 them out again. That's all.'
2617 
2618 'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much
2619 about a whiting before.'
2620 
2621 'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you
2622 know why it's called a whiting?'
2623 
2624 'I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'
2625 
2626 'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.
2627 
2628 Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated
2629 in a wondering tone.
2630 
2631 'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what
2632 makes them so shiny?'
2633 
2634 Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
2635 answer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.'
2636 
2637 'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
2638 'are done with a whiting. Now you know.'
2639 
2640 'And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.
2641 
2642 'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
2643 'any shrimp could have told you that.'
2644 
2645 'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running
2646 on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please: we
2647 don't want YOU with us!"'
2648 
2649 'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'no
2650 wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'
2651 
2652 'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.
2653 
2654 'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and
2655 told me he was going a journey, I should say "With what porpoise?"'
2656 
2657 'Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.
2658 
2659 'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
2660 the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.'
2661 
2662 'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said
2663 Alice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday,
2664 because I was a different person then.'
2665 
2666 'Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.
2667 
2668 'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
2669 'explanations take such a dreadful time.'
2670 
2671 So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
2672 saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
2673 the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
2674 their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went
2675 on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
2676 her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the
2677 words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,
2678 and said 'That's very curious.'
2679 
2680 'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.
2681 
2682 'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'I
2683 should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
2684 begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
2685 authority over Alice.
2686 
2687 'Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said the
2688 Gryphon.
2689 
2690 'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'
2691 thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, she
2692 got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
2693 Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
2694 very queer indeed:--
2695 
2696   ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
2697   "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
2698   As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
2699   Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'
2700 
2701        [later editions continued as follows
2702   When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
2703   And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
2704   But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
2705   His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
2706 
2707 'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the
2708 Gryphon.
2709 
2710 'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds
2711 uncommon nonsense.'
2712 
2713 Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
2714 wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.
2715 
2716 'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.
2717 
2718 'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next
2719 verse.'
2720 
2721 'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them
2722 out with his nose, you know?'
2723 
2724 'It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully
2725 puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
2726 
2727 'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it
2728 begins "I passed by his garden."'
2729 
2730 Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
2731 wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--
2732 
2733   'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
2734   How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'
2735 
2736     [later editions continued as follows
2737   The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
2738   While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
2739   When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
2740   Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
2741   While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
2742   And concluded the banquet--]
2743 
2744 'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle
2745 interrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most
2746 confusing thing I ever heard!'
2747 
2748 'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was
2749 only too glad to do so.
2750 
2751 'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went
2752 on. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'
2753 
2754 'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice
2755 replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
2756 'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, old
2757 fellow?'
2758 
2759 The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
2760 with sobs, to sing this:--
2761 
2762    'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
2763    Waiting in a hot tureen!
2764    Who for such dainties would not stoop?
2765    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
2766    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
2767      Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
2768      Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
2769    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
2770      Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
2771 
2772    'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
2773    Game, or any other dish?
2774    Who would not give all else for two
2775    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
2776    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
2777      Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
2778      Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
2779    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
2780      Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'
2781 
2782 'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
2783 to repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the
2784 distance.
2785 
2786 'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
2787 off, without waiting for the end of the song.
2788 
2789 'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
2790 answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
2791 came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--
2792 
2793    'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
2794      Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'
2795

2798 
2799 CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?
2800 
2801 The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
2802 arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
2803 birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
2804 standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
2805 him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,
2806 and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court
2807 was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,
2808 that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the
2809 trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there
2810 seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
2811 her, to pass away the time.
2812 
2813 Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
2814 about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
2815 the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to
2816 herself, 'because of his great wig.'
2817 
2818 The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
2819 wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did
2820 not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.
2821 
2822 'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'
2823 (she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were
2824 animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said
2825 this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of
2826 it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her
2827 age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done
2828 just as well.
2829 
2830 The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they
2831 doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put
2832 down yet, before the trial's begun.'
2833 
2834 'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for
2835 fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'
2836 
2837 'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
2838 hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the
2839 King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who
2840 was talking.
2841 
2842 Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
2843 that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,
2844 and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell
2845 'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice
2846 muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.
2847 
2848 One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
2849 could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
2850 very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
2851 that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
2852 at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
2853 obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
2854 of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
2855 
2856 'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.
2857 
2858 On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
2859 unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--
2860 
2861    'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
2862       All on a summer day:
2863     The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
2864       And took them quite away!'
2865 
2866 'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.
2867 
2868 'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great
2869 deal to come before that!'
2870 
2871 'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three
2872 blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'
2873 
2874 The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one
2875 hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your
2876 Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished
2877 my tea when I was sent for.'
2878 
2879 'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'
2880 
2881 The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
2882 court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it
2883 was,' he said.
2884 
2885 'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.
2886 
2887 'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.
2888 
2889 'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
2890 wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
2891 reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
2892 
2893 'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.
2894 
2895 'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.
2896 
2897 'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a
2898 memorandum of the fact.
2899 
2900 'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of
2901 my own. I'm a hatter.'
2902 
2903 Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
2904 who turned pale and fidgeted.
2905 
2906 'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have
2907 you executed on the spot.'
2908 
2909 This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
2910 from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in
2911 his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
2912 bread-and-butter.
2913 
2914 Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
2915 her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
2916 grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
2917 the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
2918 long as there was room for her.
2919 
2920 'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting
2921 next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'
2922 
2923 'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'
2924 
2925 'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.
2926 
2927 'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing
2928 too.'
2929 
2930 'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that
2931 ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
2932 other side of the court.
2933 
2934 All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
2935 just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
2936 of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on
2937 which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
2938 
2939 'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you
2940 executed, whether you're nervous or not.'
2941 
2942 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
2943 '--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
2944 bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'
2945 
2946 'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.
2947 
2948 'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.
2949 
2950 'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you
2951 take me for a dunce? Go on!'
2952 
2953 'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after
2954 that--only the March Hare said--'
2955 
2956 'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
2957 
2958 'You did!' said the Hatter.
2959 
2960 'I deny it!' said the March Hare.
2961 
2962 'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'
2963 
2964 'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking
2965 anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
2966 nothing, being fast asleep.
2967 
2968 'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'
2969 
2970 'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.
2971 
2972 'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.
2973 
2974 'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'
2975 
2976 The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
2977 down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.
2978 
2979 'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.
2980 
2981 Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
2982 the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
2983 explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
2984 up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
2985 head first, and then sat upon it.)
2986 
2987 'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read
2988 in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts
2989 at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
2990 court," and I never understood what it meant till now.'
2991 
2992 'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the
2993 King.
2994 
2995 'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.'
2996 
2997 'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.
2998 
2999 Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
3000 
3001 'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get
3002 on better.'
3003 
3004 'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the
3005 Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
3006 
3007 'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
3008 without even waiting to put his shoes on.
3009 
3010 '--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the
3011 officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
3012 to the door.
3013 
3014 'Call the next witness!' said the King.
3015 
3016 The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in
3017 her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
3018 court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
3019 
3020 'Give your evidence,' said the King.
3021 
3022 'Shan't,' said the cook.
3023 
3024 The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
3025 'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'
3026 
3027 'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
3028 after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
3029 nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'
3030 
3031 'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.
3032 
3033 'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.
3034 
3035 'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse!
3036 Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
3037 whiskers!'
3038 
3039 For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
3040 turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
3041 disappeared.
3042 
3043 'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. 'Call the next
3044 witness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear,
3045 YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
3046 ache!'
3047 
3048 Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
3049 curious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't
3050 got much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when
3051 the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the
3052 name 'Alice!'
3053 
3054 
3055 
3056 
3057 CHAPTER XII. Alice's Evidence
3058 
3059 
3060 'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
3061 large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
3062 a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
3063 upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
3064 they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish
3065 she had accidentally upset the week before.
3066 
3067 'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
3068 began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
3069 the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea
3070 that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
3071 they would die.
3072 
3073 'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until
3074 all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with
3075 great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.
3076 
3077 Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
3078 the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
3079 tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got
3080 it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said
3081 to herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial
3082 one way up as the other.'
3083 
3084 As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
3085 upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
3086 them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
3087 accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
3088 anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
3089 court.
3090 
3091 'What do you know about this business?' the King said to Alice.
3092 
3093 'Nothing,' said Alice.
3094 
3095 'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.
3096 
3097 'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.
3098 
3099 'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They were
3100 just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit
3101 interrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a
3102 very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.
3103 
3104 'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on
3105 to himself in an undertone,
3106 
3107 'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying
3108 which word sounded best.
3109 
3110 Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'
3111 Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
3112 'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.
3113 
3114 At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
3115 his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule
3116 Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'
3117 
3118 Everybody looked at Alice.
3119 
3120 'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.
3121 
3122 'You are,' said the King.
3123 
3124 'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
3125 
3126 'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a
3127 regular rule: you invented it just now.'
3128 
3129 'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
3130 
3131 'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
3132 
3133 The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your
3134 verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
3135 
3136 'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White
3137 Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked
3138 up.'
3139 
3140 'What's in it?' said the Queen.
3141 
3142 'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a
3143 letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'
3144 
3145 'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to
3146 nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'
3147 
3148 'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.
3149 
3150 'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's
3151 nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and
3152 added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'
3153 
3154 'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen.
3155 
3156 'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing
3157 about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)
3158 
3159 'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury
3160 all brightened up again.)
3161 
3162 'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they
3163 can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'
3164 
3165 'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter
3166 worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your
3167 name like an honest man.'
3168 
3169 There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
3170 clever thing the King had said that day.
3171 
3172 'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.
3173 
3174 'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even know
3175 what they're about!'
3176 
3177 'Read them,' said the King.
3178 
3179 The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please
3180 your Majesty?' he asked.
3181 
3182 'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you
3183 come to the end: then stop.'
3184 
3185 These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--
3186 
3187    'They told me you had been to her,
3188     And mentioned me to him:
3189    She gave me a good character,
3190     But said I could not swim.
3191 
3192    He sent them word I had not gone
3193     (We know it to be true):
3194    If she should push the matter on,
3195     What would become of you?
3196 
3197    I gave her one, they gave him two,
3198     You gave us three or more;
3199    They all returned from him to you,
3200     Though they were mine before.
3201 
3202    If I or she should chance to be
3203     Involved in this affair,
3204    He trusts to you to set them free,
3205     Exactly as we were.
3206 
3207    My notion was that you had been
3208     (Before she had this fit)
3209    An obstacle that came between
3210     Him, and ourselves, and it.
3211 
3212    Don't let him know she liked them best,
3213     For this must ever be
3214    A secret, kept from all the rest,
3215     Between yourself and me.'
3216 
3217 'That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the
3218 King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--'
3219 
3220 'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large
3221 in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting
3222 him,) 'I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of
3223 meaning in it.'
3224 
3225 The jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an
3226 atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.
3227 
3228 'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of
3229 trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'
3230 he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them
3231 with one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID
3232 I COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the
3233 Knave.
3234 
3235 The Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he
3236 certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)
3237 
3238 'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over
3239 the verses to himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of
3240 course--"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he
3241 did with the tarts, you know--'
3242 
3243 'But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.
3244 
3245 'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts
3246 on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE
3247 HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the
3248 Queen.
3249 
3250 'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
3251 as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
3252 slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
3253 began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as
3254 it lasted.)
3255 
3256 'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court
3257 with a smile. There was a dead silence.
3258 
3259 'It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,
3260 'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the
3261 twentieth time that day.
3262 
3263 'No, no!' said the Queen. 'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'
3264 
3265 'Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. 'The idea of having the
3266 sentence first!'
3267 
3268 'Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.
3269 
3270 'I won't!' said Alice.
3271 
3272 'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
3273 moved.
3274 
3275 'Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this
3276 time.) 'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'
3277 
3278 At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
3279 her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
3280 tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
3281 head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
3282 leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.
3283 
3284 'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've
3285 had!'
3286 
3287 'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her
3288 sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures
3289 of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
3290 finished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream,
3291 dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So
3292 Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
3293 what a wonderful dream it had been.
3294 
3295 But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
3296 hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her
3297 wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
3298 this was her dream:--
3299 
3300 First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
3301 hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
3302 up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
3303 queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
3304 WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to
3305 listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
3306 of her little sister's dream.
3307 
3308 The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the
3309 frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
3310 could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
3311 shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
3312 ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
3313 was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed
3314 around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
3315 Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
3316 filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
3317 Turtle.
3318 
3319 So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
3320 Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
3321 would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the
3322 wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling
3323 teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill
3324 cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the
3325 shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she
3326 knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing
3327 of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's
3328 heavy sobs.
3329 
3330 Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
3331 would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
3332 keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
3333 childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and
3334 make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even
3335 with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with
3336 all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
3337 remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
3338 
3339               THE END
