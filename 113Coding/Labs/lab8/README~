Lab 8

Purpose: 
  The lab's goal was to learn simple manipulations of a linked list as well
as learn how learn how to properly malloc and free allocated memory.

Pseudo-code:
  See prelab 8.

Conclusion:
a) What I learned from this lab:
  I primarily learned from this lab how to step through a linked list when
it was only possible to transverse the list in one direction.  While for some
of the questions it presented no difficulty, for other functions, such as the
insert_middle and the delete_node it presented some difficulties.

b)  Issues and how I fixed them:
  The functions that could delete or insert nodes into the middle of the list
where difficult to approach, so I had to draw pictures to ensure I would have
the proper pointers.  Otherwise, a couple of the while loops would have off by
one errors that were wasy to fix.

c)  Improvements that can be made:
  My program has little in the wasy of checking user input.  For instance, a
character would cause major problems in the program, and inputing a negative
position for insert_middle would cause unexpected problems.  With a little
more programing and functions, this could easily be fixed.
