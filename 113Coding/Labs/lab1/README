Purpose:  To calculate certain properties of a rectangle, right triangle, circle, and regular polygon given some specific
values entered by the user.

Conclusion(s):

(a) The basic construction order of a program
  The order in which the program is coded is major, as it can possilby create more work than needed.  I found that out
when I coded user input for the rectangle first, and then had to go back and redo when I created the output.  Doing output
first in the other sections prevented this.

(b)  Compile often
  It is best to compile often, even if one expects certain errors, and to fix the unexpected errors.  I didn't do so until about half of the code was written, and it was very frustrating.  The last half I compiled often, fixing the issues.
