Lab 3

Purpose: Create a library of array functions, that includes basic comparisons,
math, and sorting.  Also includes a rock-spock game and a program that 
executes Luhn's algorithm.   

Peusdo Code:

1) 
// count elements in an array less than m
// A[1, N], an array with N elements
count = 0

for i = 1 to N
        if A[i] < m
                count++

return count

2) 
// count elements in an array less than 
// or equal to m
// A[1, N], an array with N elements
count = 0

for i = 1 to N
        if A[i] <= m
                count++

return count

3) 
// count elements in an array greater than m
// A[1, N], an array with N elements
count = 0

for i = 1 to N
        if A[i] > m
                count++

return count

4) 
// count elements in an array greater than m
// A[1, N], an array with N elements
count = 0

for i = 1 to N
        if A[i] >= m
                count++

return count

17)
// reverse the order of an array
// A[1, N] an array with N elements
temp

for i = 1 to N/2
        temp = A[i]
        A[i] = A[N + 1 - i]
        A[N + 1 - i] = temp

20)
// count the number of even numbers in an array
// A[1, N] an array with N elements
count = 0
for i = 1 to N
        if A[1] / 2 == 0 // if A[i] is even 
                count ++

return count

22)
// count the number of odd numbers in an array
// A[1, N] an array with N elements
count = 0
for i = 1 to N
        if A[1] / 2 == 1 // if A[i] is odd 
                count ++

return count

24)
// count the number of elements divisble by a given array
// A[1, N] an array with N elements, and a given value
count = 0
for i = 1 to N
        if A[1] / value == 0 // if A[i] is divisble by value 
                count ++

return count

Conclusion:
A)  What I learned in this lab:
  I learned how to create a library.  Also, through people explaining the array.h file, I also learned how the library is
  only included once with the #ifndef preprocessor directive.  I also learned how to create an insertion sort as well, 
  which I will be using over the bubble sort from now on.

B)  Issues and how I fixed it:
  One prominent issue that I had as I went along was I had array indexing errors when transferring from peusdo code
  to C due to indexing starting at 1 versus 0.  What I ended up doing was hardcoding -1 into some functions in order to fix
  the issue.

C)  Improvments that can be made:
  The lab3 file can have a more rubust user inferace.  Implemented via a switch statment, the user would choose a number to
  choose what information to print to the screen.  The program with Luhn's algorithm would also need an user input for the
  numbers.
