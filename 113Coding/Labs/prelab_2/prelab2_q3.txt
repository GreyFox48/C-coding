The two programs above are equivalent in terms of use.  They both do execute an unique block of code depending
on what specific integer was inputed.  While I can see the if statement being more useful for ranges of numbers,
the switch statement would be better for a series of individual cases.  In this lab, the switch statement is 
easier to understand due to being more sparse.
