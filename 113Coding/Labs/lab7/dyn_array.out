Lacks prompt inputs due to them being inputed into terminal, and thus were not
captured.

This program can find the min, max, median, and mean of an inputed array of integers.
0: Calculate array statistics and exit program
1: Input new number
Input an integer for the array: 0: Calculate array statistics and exit program

The array elements are: 4	6	2	4	9	11	14	16	1	15	3
The min of the array is 1
The max of the array is 16
The mean of the array is 7.73
The median of the array is 6.0
