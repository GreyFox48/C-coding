Puropose:
        The purpose of this lab was to gain experiance in the utilization of
pointers in single varaibles and in arrays.  The lab also introduced the use
of allocating memory in the heap, and how it is to be used and how it must
also be freed.

Conclusions:

a) What I learned from this lab:
        In short, I learned how to use malloc and to a lesser extend realloc,
despite realloc not being required for the lab.  I also switched between 
pointers and pointer arithmetic to go through the arrays, though this
presented less problems than using malloc and realloc, due to pointer errors.
The most difficult part of the lab was pointer issues related to malloc and 
realloc.

b)  Issues and how I fixed them:
        The largest issue was again pointer issues related to assigning data
after the malloc was used.  The original program would have issues
after the 7th element consistently, and that was due to what appeared to be
data being assigned to the worng address value.  This was fixed via replication
as gdb was not very helpful in tracking the issue.

c)  Improvements that could be made:
        The input for the dyanamic array program could be simplified to simply
take values until the user denotes otherswise, rather than repeatedly asking
whether to continue.  It also could simply take a specific number of numbers
decided by the user but I wanted to have practice in using realloc.
