Lab 4

Purpose:  
  To use structures by themselves and inside arrays in order to perform some calculations.  Also continued working with integer 
arrays using a custom library, and briefly touched upon enumerated types.

Conclusions:  
a) What I learned from this lab:
  I learned how to create an array of structures, and how to access the structures' members both in and out of arrays, along with reinforcing 
my learning with headers files in C.  Also learned how to use and declare enumerated types, specifically on how to assing enumerated types 
values.
b)  Issues and how I fixed them:
  As I was implementing the user interface in the lab4_q4 (the zodiac calander) assignment, I found an error where after the user inputed their birthdate, the
program would continiously display messages until it was forced to stop.  I learned that the scanf function also needed the "/" symbols to 
be included inside the input string to prevent this.  I had previouly thought the buffer would simply have ignored the "/" symbols, but I was wrong.
c)  Improvements that can be made:
  The zodiac calander program could use more error checking, as it currently only works utalizing one format.  Also, the array_struct.c file could
use an user interface in order to input information, to make the program more useful.
