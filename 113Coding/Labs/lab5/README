Lab5

Purpose:
  To create a basic database that does basic looping overwriting, along with various basic coding challenges
that came from Project Euler

a)  What I learned from this lab:
  I learned in this lab how to create a small database using a structure array and how to overwrite previous entries
once a certain size was surpassed.  I also learned new ways to pass an array to a function

b)  Issues and how I fixed them:
  The database print function was originally designed to print five elements no matter what.  The problem that resulted
was it printing various junk data if less than five entries had been inputed.  I fixed this by creating another
conditional in the for loop for the printing fuction that prevents the print fucntion to print more data entries
that had been inputed.

I also learned when to look out for stack overflow.  One of the questions makes the computer compute a large number,
far too large for an integer, and it at first caused a bizzare number.  It was then fixed using a long instead of an int.

c) Improvments that can be made:
  All of the Project Euler progams can use user input to find more specific numbers, or at least to change the range
the programs use to compute their numbers.  Also, the zombie database could use a more robust methods to check user input,
though some already exits.
